Q:So what's not working?
A: We got everything working that we set out to do.

Q: Why's this not v1.0 yet?
A: Design and implementation issues. Submitting multiple answers for clicker questions is probably not desirable. Same for being able to upvote things more than once, etc. Also no login means that this is going to be weird to deal with, as we have no student-identification system outside their IP (which we will probably have to use, or store ALL usage data in cookies, not really ideal)
